# Coding Guidelines

This document contains the coding guidelines for the ASPIRE Python project.

## Coding Style

In order to keep the code consistent, please read and follow [PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008)
and [PEP 257 Docstring Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) guidelines. [This webpage](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/) is a good guide for documenting Python Code. 
For automatic checking of style problems, [Pycharm from Jet Brains](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) 
is a good candidate which has the professional version for academic users with free license fee. 


## Best Practices

For beginners in scientific computing, some general guides are suggested in Greg Wilson's papers as below:

 1. [Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing]( https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510) 
 2. [Best Practices for Scientific Computing]( https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745) 


## Source Code Control

As an open source software, we using Git and GitHub for our source code control. 
The following links are useful tutorials. 
1. Git tutorials from [Atalassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) and [Git-SCM](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
2. GitHub guides from [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/) 

## Git Workflow Changes

Our project follows [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
Please submit any PRs against the `develop` branch.
