Installation
============

ASPIRE is based on Python 3.6, and comes with an ``environment.yml`` for reconstructing a working Conda environment to run the package.
The package is tested on Linux/Windows/Mac OS X. Pre-built binaries are available for all platform-specific components. No manual
compilation should be needed.

Install Conda
*************

To follow the suggested installation, you will need to install Conda for **Python3**, either
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux>`__ or
`Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`__, click on the right
distribution to view Conda's installation instructions.

.. note::
   If you're not sure which distribution is right for you, go with `Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`__

Install and Activate the environment
************************************

For most end users, simply installing the package is sufficient to use ASPIRE.
The commands in this section should install ASPIRE directly from the ``Python Package Index`` into your activated environment.
This does not require checking out source code.
If you are interested in checking out and working with the source code, running tests, or a different flavor of install,
then skip to the next section now instead.

Once ``conda`` is installed and available on the path, we can create a fresh ``conda`` environment.
Here we have chosen to name it ``aspire_env``, but you may choose any name you like so long as that name is used consistently in the following step.
After creating the environment, we activate it.
Finally, we install the ``aspire`` package inside the activated environment. This should install all supporting Python software required.

::

   conda create --name aspire_env python=3.6 pip
   conda activate aspire_env
   pip install aspire

.. note::
    Installing the package installs ASPIRE to the ``site-packages`` folder of your active environment.
    This is only desirable if you are not going to be doing any development on ASPIRE,
    but simply want to run scripts that depend on the ASPIRE package.


Alternative Developer Installations
************************************

Developers are expected to be able to manage their own code and environments.
However, for consistency and newcomers, we recommend the following procedure using `conda`.
Note that here the name ``aspire_dev`` was chosen, but you may choose any name for the ``conda`` environment.
Some people use different environment names for different features,
but this is personal preference and will largely depend on what type of changes you are making.
For example, if you are making changes to dependent package versions for testing,
you would probably want to keep that in a seperate environment.

::

   # Acquire the code.
   git clone -b develop https://github.com/ComputationalCryoEM/ASPIRE-Python
   cd ASPIRE-Python

   # Create's the conda environment and installs base dependencies.
   conda env create -f environment.yml --name aspire_dev

   # Activate the environment
   conda activate aspire_dev

   # Command to install the aspire package in a locally editable way:
   pip install -e .

We recommend using ``conda`` or a ``virtualenv`` environment managing solutions because ASPIRE may have conflicts or change installed versions of Python packages on your system.

Again, we recommend the above for consistency.
However, ASPIRE is a ``pip`` package,
so you can attempt to install it using standard ``pip`` or ``setup.py`` commands.  There are methods such as ``pip --no-deps`` that can leave your other packages undisturbed, but this is left to the developer.
ASPIRE should generally be compatible with newer version of Python, and newer dependent packages. We are currently testing 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 base Python as configured by ASPIRE, and with upgrading packages to the latest for each of those bases.
If you encounter an issue with a custom pip install, we will try to help, but you may be on your own for support of this method of installation.

::

   # Standard pip site-packages installation command
   cd path/to/aspire-repo
   pip install .

   # Standard pip developer installation
   cd path/to/aspire-repo
   pip install -e .


Test the package
****************

Make sure all unit tests run correctly by doing:

::

    cd /path/to/git/clone/folder
    pytest

Tests currently take around 5 minutes to run, but this depends on your specific machine's resources.


Generating Documentation
************************

Sphinx Documentation of the source (a local copy of what you're looking at right now) can be generated using:

::

    cd /path/to/git/clone/folder/docs
    sphinx-apidoc -f -o ./source ../src -H Modules
    make clean
    make html

The built html files can be found at ``/path/to/git/clone/folder/docs/build/html``
