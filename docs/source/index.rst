Algorithms for Single Particle Reconstruction
*********************************************

Our project aims to develop mathematical theory, improved algorithms, and software for 3-D molecular structure determination
using cryo-EM. Our methods use a combination of tools from different areas of mathematics, statistics, and computer science,
such as computerized tomography, optimization (convex and non-convex), random matrix theory, signal and image processing,
linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction, randomized algorithms in numerical linear algebra, and representation theory.
