Ab-initio Pipeline Demonstration
================================

This tutorial demonstrates some key components of an ab-initio
reconstruction pipeline using synthetic data generated with ASPIRE's
``Simulation`` class of objects.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 11-17

Download an Example Volume
--------------------------
We begin by downloading a high resolution volume map of the 80S
Ribosome, sourced from EMDB: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/EMD-2660.
This is one of several volume maps that can be downloaded with
ASPIRE's data downloading utility by using the following import.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 17-30

.. code-block:: Python



    from aspire.downloader import emdb_2660

    # Load 80s Ribosome as a ``Volume`` object.
    original_vol = emdb_2660()

    # During the preprocessing stages of the pipeline we will downsample
    # the images to an image size of 64 pixels. Here, we also downsample the
    # volume so we can compare to our reconstruction later.
    res = 64
    vol_ds = original_vol.downsample(res)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 34-39

.. note::
    A ``Volume`` can be saved using the ``Volume.save()`` method as follows::

        fn = f"downsampled_80s_ribosome_size{res}.mrc"
        vol_ds.save(fn, overwrite=True)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 42-49

Create a Simulation Source
--------------------------
ASPIRE's ``Simulation`` class can be used to generate a synthetic
dataset of projection images.  A ``Simulation`` object produces
random projections of a supplied Volume and applies noise and CTF
filters. The resulting stack of 2D images is stored in an ``Image``
object.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-58

CTF Filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let's start by creating CTF filters. The ``operators`` package
contains a collection of filter classes that can be supplied to a
``Simulation``.  We use ``RadialCTFFilter`` to generate a set of CTF
filters with various defocus values.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 58-74

.. code-block:: Python


    # Create CTF filters
    import numpy as np

    from aspire.operators import RadialCTFFilter

    # Radial CTF Filter
    defocus_min = 15000  # unit is angstroms
    defocus_max = 25000
    defocus_ct = 7

    ctf_filters = [
        RadialCTFFilter(defocus=d)
        for d in np.linspace(defocus_min, defocus_max, defocus_ct)
    ]








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 75-87

Initialize Simulation Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We feed our ``Volume`` and filters into ``Simulation`` to generate
the dataset of images.  When controlled white Gaussian noise is
desired, ``WhiteNoiseAdder(var=VAR)`` can be used to generate a
simulation data set around a specific noise variance.

Alternatively, users can bring their own images using an
``ArrayImageSource``, or define their own custom noise functions via
``Simulation(..., noise_adder=CustomNoiseAdder(...))``.  Examples
can be found in ``tutorials/class_averaging.py`` and
``experiments/simulated_abinitio_pipeline.py``.

.. code-block:: Python


    from aspire.noise import WhiteNoiseAdder
    from aspire.source import Simulation

    # For this ``Simulation`` we set all 2D offset vectors to zero,
    # but by default offset vectors will be randomly distributed.
    # We cache the Simulation to prevent regenerating the projections
    # for each preprocessing stage.
    src = Simulation(
        n=2500,  # number of projections
        vols=original_vol,  # volume source
        offsets=0,  # Default: images are randomly shifted

  The noise variance value above was chosen based on other parameters for this
  quick tutorial, and can be changed to adjust the power of the additive noise.
  Alternatively, an SNR value can be prescribed as follows::

We apply some image preprocessing techniques to prepare the
the images for denoising via Class Averaging.

We downsample the images. Reducing the image size will improve the
efficiency of subsequent pipeline stages. Metadata such as pixel size is
scaled accordingly to correspond correctly with the image resolution.

pipeline up to this point.  This is optional, but can provide
benefit when used intently on machines with adequate memory.

Class Averaging
---------------
For this tutorial we use the ``DebugClassAvgSource`` to generate an ``ImageSource``
of class averages. Internally, ``DebugClassAvgSource`` uses the ``RIRClass2D``
object to classify the source images via the rotationally invariant representation
(RIR) algorithm and the ``TopClassSelector`` object to select the first ``n_classes``
images in the original order from the source. In practice, class selection is commonly
done by sorting class averages based on some configurable notion of quality
(contrast, neighbor distance etc) which can be accomplished by providing a custom
class selector to ``ClassAverageSource``, which changes the ordering of the classes
returned by ``ClassAverageSource``.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 196-212

.. code-block:: Python


    from aspire.denoising import DebugClassAvgSource

    avgs = DebugClassAvgSource(src=src)

    # We'll continue our pipeline using only the first ``n_classes`` from
    # ``avgs``.  The ``cache()`` call is used here to precompute results
    # for the ``:n_classes`` slice.  This avoids recomputing the same
    # images twice when peeking in the next cell then requesting them in
    # the following ``CLSyncVoting`` algorithm.  Outside of demonstration
    # purposes, where we are repeatedly peeking at various stage results,
    # such caching can be dropped allowing for more lazy evaluation.
    n_classes = 250

Orientation Estimation
----------------------
We create an ``OrientedSource``, which consumes an ``ImageSource`` object, an
orientation estimator, and returns a new source which lazily estimates orientations.
In this case we supply ``avgs`` for our source and a ``CLSyncVoting``
class instance for our orientation estimator. The ``CLSyncVoting`` algorithm employs
a common-lines method with synchronization and voting.

Mean Error of Estimated Rotations
---------------------------------
ASPIRE has the built-in utility function, ``mean_aligned_angular_distance``, which globally
aligns the estimated rotations to the true rotations and computes the mean
angular distance (in degrees).

Volume Reconstruction
---------------------
Now that we have our class averages and rotation estimates, we can
estimate the mean volume by supplying the class averages and basis
for back projection.

Comparison of Estimated Volume with Source Volume
-------------------------------------------------
To get a visual confirmation that our results are sane, we rotate
the estimated volume by the estimated rotations and project along
the z-axis.  These estimated projections should align with the
original projection images.

Fourier Shell Correlation
-------------------------
Additionally, we can compare our reconstruction to the known source volume
by performing a Fourier shell correlation (FSC). We first find a rotation
matrix which best aligns the estimated rotations to the ground truth rotations
using the ``find_registration`` method. We then use that rotation to align
the reconstructed volume to the ground truth volume.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 312-323

.. code-block:: Python


    # `find_registration` returns the best aligning rotation, `Q`, as well as
    # a `flag` which indicates if the volume needs to be reflected.
    Q, flag = Rotation(est_rotations).find_registration(true_rotations)
    aligned_vol = estimated_volume
    if flag == 1:
        aligned_vol = aligned_vol.flip()
    aligned_vol = aligned_vol.rotate(Rotation(Q.T))
