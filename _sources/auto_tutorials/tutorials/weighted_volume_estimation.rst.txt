Weighted Volume Reconstruction
==============================

This tutorial demonstrates a weighted volume reconstruction,
using a published reference dataset.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 10-17

Download an Example Dataset
---------------------------
ASPIRE's downloader will download, cache,
and unpack the reference dataset.
More information about the dataset can be found on
`Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/records/8186548>`_
and in this `paper <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6420/ab4f55/ampdf>`_

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 17-33

.. code-block:: Python


    from aspire import downloader

    sim_data = downloader.simulated_channelspin()

    # This data contains a `Volume` stack, an `Image` stack, weights and
    # corresponding parameters that were used to derive images
    # from the volumes.  For example, the rotations below are the known
    # true simulation projection rotations. In practice these would be
    # derived from an orientation estimation component.

    imgs = sim_data["images"]  # Simulated image stack (`Image` object)
    rots = sim_data["rots"]  # True projection rotations (`Rotation` object)
    weights = sim_data["weights"]  # Volume weights (`Numpy` array)
    vols = sim_data["vols"]  # True reference volumes (`Volume` object)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 34-40

Create a ``ImageSource``
------------------------
The image stack and projection rotation (Euler) angles can be
associated together during instantiation of an ``ImageSource``.
Because this example starts with a dense array of images,
an ``ArrayImageSource`` is used.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 40-49

.. code-block:: Python


    from aspire.source import ArrayImageSource

    src = ArrayImageSource(imgs, angles=rots.angles)

    # The images are downsampled for the sake of a quicker tutorial.
    # This line can be commented out to achieve the reference size (54 pixels).
    src = src.downsample(24)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 50-55

.. note::
    This tutorial demonstrates bringing reference data.
    It is also possible to just create a ``Simulation`` or use other
    ``ImageSource`` objects, so long as the rotations required
    for backprojecting are assigned.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 57-62

Volume Reconstruction
---------------------
Performing a weighted volume reconstruction requires defining an
appropriate 3D basis and supplying an associated image to volume
weight mapping as an array.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 62-82

.. code-block:: Python


    from aspire.basis import FFBBasis3D
    from aspire.reconstruction import WeightedVolumesEstimator

    # Create a reasonable Basis
    basis = FFBBasis3D(src.L, dtype=src.dtype)

    # Set up an estimator to perform the backprojections and volume estimation.
    # In this case, the `weights` array comes from the reference data set,
    # and is shaped to map images to spectral volumes.
    # Note that we can have many more actual/reference volumes generating
    # the image stack than spectral volumes.  In this case the input
    # images were generated from 54 volumes, but are described by 16
    # spectral volumes.
    print("`weights shape:`", weights.shape)
    estimator = WeightedVolumesEstimator(weights, src, basis, preconditioner="none")

    # Perform the estimation, returning a `Volume` stack.
    estimated_volume = estimator.estimate()

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 83-86

.. note::
    The ``estimate()`` method requires a fair amount of compute time,
    but there should be regularly logged progress towards convergence.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 88-102

Comparison of Estimated Volume with Source Volume
-------------------------------------------------
Generate several random projections rotations, then compare these
projections between the estimated spectral volumes and a known volume.
If ``src`` was downsampled above, the resulting estimated volumes
and projections will be of similar downsampled quality.

Note that the estimated spectral volumes are treated as `Volume`
objects purely for convienience and are not expected to correspond
exactly to any particular reference volume.  The spectral volumes
collectively describe motion features derived from the input data.
However, basic visual comparison is useful as a sanity check to
demonstrate that we are in fact generating spectral volumes that
appear reasonably similar to the input volumes.
