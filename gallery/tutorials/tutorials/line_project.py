Radon Transform
=======================================

This tutorial will demonstrate how to set up and use ASPIRE's ``Sinogram`` and ``Image`` class methods to apply forward and backward projections using Radon and Inverse-Radon Transforms.
This document is designed to provide you with a step-by-step tutorial on how to use the corresponding classes and methods.

# %%
# Overview
# --------
# For our demonstration, we will first illustrate the forward ``project`` method within the ``Image`` class. Let's begin by processing an image from ``skimage`` and applying a mask.

# loading the image
image = data.camera().astype(np.float64)
img_size = image.shape[0]
image_without_mask = Image(image)

# masking the image for the line projections
grid = grid_2d(img_size, normalized=True, shifted=True)
mask = grid["r"] < 1
masked_image = image * mask
image_camera = Image(masked_image)

# plotting
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(16, 8))
axes[0].imshow(image_without_mask.asnumpy()[0], cmap="gray", aspect="auto")
axes[0].set_title("Camera Man")
image = axes[1].imshow(image_camera.asnumpy()[0], cmap="gray", aspect="auto")
axes[1].set_title("Masked Camera Man")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()


# %%
# Forward Projection
# --------
# Next, let's apply the ``project`` method from ASPIRE's ``Image`` class.
# To use this method, it's crucial to convert our data into an ``Image`` object and pass in an input which will be a set of angles in radians.
# From the previous lines, our image is already an ``Image`` object so we can start to apply our ``project`` method.

rads_5 = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 5, endpoint=False)
sinogram_5 = image_camera.project(rads_5)

# %%
# Visualization of the Projection
# --------
# As we can see, the process of taking the forward projection using ``project`` is straightforward. We just need a set of angles in radians.
# The follwing lines of code are only to visualize what our sinogram will look like. It's important to note that our sinogram only has five line projections.
# We will continue to add more line projections throughout the demonstration and visualizing the results.

# create figure and axis for the original image with line projections
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8))
ax.imshow(masked_image, cmap="gray")
ax.set_title("Camera Man with 5 Line Projections")

# plotting the angle of the line projection
for angle in rads_5:
    rad_angle = np.pi * angle / 180
    ax.axline((img_size // 2, img_size // 2), slope=np.tan(rad_angle), color="r")

plt.show()


# %%
# Results with Five Projections
# --------
# As we can see below, the ``project`` method is able to take five different projections and output an ASPIRE ``Sinogram`` object.
# It's important to note that the more projections we take, the better we can construct our image when we apply the ``backproject`` method on the ``Sinogram`` Object.

# %%
# Updated Forward Projection
# --------
# Now, let's take more line projections and create a new ``Sinogram``.
# We're going to use 90 different projections and output our Sinogram.
# Just like with ``sinogram_five``, we'll apply the same process as before and output the respective graphs.

# %%
# Results with 20 Line Projections
# --------
# As we can see below, our current ``Sinogram`` is less blurry than before.
# By taking more line projections on the ``Image``, we're able to output a more refined ``Sinogram``.
# This help us with reconstructing our image through the ``backproject`` method.

# Results with Final Sinogram
# --------
# After taking 180 different line projections, we're able to produce a clearer ``Sinogram`` compared to what we had before.
# From the image above, we were able plot the angle of the line projection and its corresponding line projection values.
# The following snippet of code is just to illustrate the original image next to the ``Sinogram`` representation.

# %%
# Backwards Projection
# --------
# We can transform our line projections back into the original image through reconstruction techniques.
# The output of applying ``project`` on an ASPIRE ``Image`` object is a ``Sinogram`` object.
# Once we have our Sinogram object, the ``backproject`` method that takes in a set of radians and applies the inverse FFT to convert our line projections back to the original image.
# The following snippet of code will convert our ``sinogram_180``, which is our sinogram with 180 line projections back into the original image.

angles_180 = np.linspace(0, 360, 180, endpoint=False)
rads_180 = angles_180 / 180.0 * np.pi
back_project_180 = sinogram_180.backproject(rads_180)


# %%
# Backward Projections with 5 projections
# --------
# From above, converting from a sinogram back to an image can be pretty straightforward with our method.
# The following lines of code are simply to illustrate what the reconstructed images will look like with a varying number of line projections.
# Let's plot what five line projections would look like.

back_project_5 = sinogram_5.backproject(rads_5)

image = axes[1].imshow(image_camera.asnumpy()[0], cmap="gray", aspect="auto")
axes[1].set_title("Original Image")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# %%
# Backward Projections with 20 projections
# --------
# It's important to note that with only five projections, our reconstructed image looks nothing like our original image.
# Let's see what our ``backproject`` method outputs with 20 projections.

back_project_20 = sinogram_20.backproject(rads_20)
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(16, 8))

image = axes[1].imshow(image_camera.asnumpy()[0], cmap="gray", aspect="auto")
axes[1].set_title("Original Image")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# %%
# Backward Projections with 180 projections
# --------
# As we can see, the output image is looking a lot closer to what the original image was, but we can do better.
# Letâs visualize what our most recent sinogram looks like after applying the ``backproject`` method with 180 different line projections.
back_project_180 = sinogram_180.backproject(rads_180)
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(16, 8))
axes[0].imshow(back_project_180.asnumpy()[0], cmap="gray", aspect="auto")

image = axes[1].imshow(image_camera.asnumpy()[0], cmap="gray", aspect="auto")
axes[1].set_title("Original Image")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# %%
# Final Remarks
# --------
# As we can see, our ``backproject`` method was able to reconstruct the original image (without a filter) given our sinogram had enough line projections.
# To conclude our demonstration, it's crucial to have a sufficient number of line projections when applying the respective forward and backward project methods.
# The quality of the reconstructed image is highly dependent on the number of projections, as demonstrated through our examples.
