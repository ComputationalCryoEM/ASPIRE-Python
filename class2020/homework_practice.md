Download a 3D map from EMPIR such 10028 for the Cryo-EM structure of the Plasmodium falciparum 
80S ribosome bound to the anti-protozoan drug emetine (EMD-2660). Write a python script to perform
the following tasks.  

1. Downsample the download 3D density map to a low resolution such as 60x60x60.
2. Select two sets of Euler angles and project the downsampled 3D density map to 2D images.  
3. Find the common line between these two projected images.
4. Apply the rotational matrices to the common line and check the consistence.
